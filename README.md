# Layer Strike

A brand new competitive game mode for CS:GO.

### How it works
Layer Strike plays the same as the original CS:GO, except for the fact, that you can switch between three different layers (or dimensions, if you will).

To switch between the layers, you have to equip the specific layer-weapon.
Your primary weapon brings you to layer 1.
Your secondary weapon brings you to layer 2.
Your knife brings you to layer 3.
Your equipment (grenades, zeus and the bomb) keeps you on your current layer.

You can only see your enemies, when they are on the same layer as you are.
The same goes for your enemies.

Bulles run through every layer. So even if you cannot see your enemies, you could still hit them.

Switching between layers creates a sound, which everyone near to you can hear.
Further, you are visible to all layers for 0.1 seconds.

When the bomb is planted, all players are visible for all layers after 15 seconds.
